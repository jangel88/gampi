GAMPI: GA for MPI task placement 
or
MORR: Mutation Optimization for Rank Re-ordering
========

This code is part of a project to optimize task placement on compute nodes of Titan at
Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. It implements a 
genetic algorithm on a distributed cluster using MPI communication.
